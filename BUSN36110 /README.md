# AppDev Workspace

To start on a project, execute the following commands at a Terminal prompt (`$`):

 - Navigate to your `workspace` folder:

    ```
    cd ~/workspace
    ```
 
 - If you haven't already, download the project folder from GitHub:

    ```
    git clone [PASTE URL OF PROJECT FROM GITHUB]
    ```

    For example,
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/raghubetina-appdev/rps-html
    ```
    
 - Navigate into the project folder:

    ```
    cd [PROJECT FOLDER NAME]
    ```

    For example,
    
    ```
    cd rps-html
    ```
    
 - Follow the instructions in the project README.

    Usually, the next steps are to
    
    1. If you haven't already, setup the project: `bin/setup`
    1. Start the Rails server: `bin/server`
    1. Navigate to the live app in a Chrome tab.
